# Recreation: Stockholm 70 :books:

This is a recreation of the Stockholm website template number 70. 

This practice is part of several recreations that I have carried out in a course I am taking to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This particular practice has been to work on in depth :black_medium_square::black_medium_small_square::black_small_square: display grid	:black_small_square::black_medium_small_square::black_medium_square: and learn how to make it responsive:iphone:.
